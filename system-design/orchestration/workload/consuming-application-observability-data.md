Workload orchestration or observability platform vendors MAY choose to consume observability data exported from the end user's devices to provide valuable services to the end user.

The end user MAY choose to export observability data from Margo compliant devices to other OpenTelemetry collectors or backends within their environment that is not on the device.

> **Note**: See the [application observability overview](../../margo-overview/application-observability-overview.md) page for more information about application observablity.
